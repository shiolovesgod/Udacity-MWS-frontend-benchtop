#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## What is this anyway?

Hi there, thanks for checking out my **Restaurant Reviews** project.  This project was a part of my training course for Google's Mobile Web Specialist certification.  The base code was provided by Udacity, and little by little it blossomed into a fully functional, responsive, offline, and accessible web app. 

### Project Overview: Stage 1

In stage one of the project, I transformed the raw code into a responsive and accessible website.  This ensures that users on screens of all sizes, and with different accessibility needs were able to effectively (and efficiently) access the content in my web app.

### Project Overview: Stage 2

This stage of the project focused on IndexedDB caching and performance optimization. 

## How do I get up and running (as a reviewer)?

1. This project has modified the original content of the "localDiskDB.db" file, I store a little more inforamtion about the reviews in my database.  So first, replace the content of the "./tmp/localDiskDB.db" file on your server hosting the database with the file I have attached.

2. Start the server hosting the database.  I assume that it's hosted on: 
```
"http://localhost:1337/restaurants"
```

3. Launch the dist/index.html folder in your browser and you should be all set.
